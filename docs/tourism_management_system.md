## 1. INTRODUCTION
### 1.1 Project Overview
The Tourism Management System mini project is designed to simplify and digitalize the process of managing tours and travel services. It allows tourists to browse destinations, select tour packages, book tickets, and reserve hotels conveniently. It helps travel agencies manage customer details, bookings, payments, and package information efficiently, reducing manual work and providing accurate information to both customers and agencies. This mini project demonstrates the core features of a real-world tourism application in a simple and user-friendly manner.

## 2. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis examines the current situation to improve it through better processes and methods. It involves gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending changes. Before computerizing a system, it must be analyzed to understand its current functioning, problems, and requirements.

### 2.1 Problem Analysis
Manual management of tourism activities leads to errors, confusion, double bookings, missing information, and poor coordination. Tourists struggle to get updated information, reducing satisfaction. The manual process is slow, inefficient, and unreliable. The Tourism Management System solves these problems by organizing data, improving booking accuracy, and making information accessible.

#### 2.1.1 Existing System
- Paper-based or spreadsheet tracking
- Manual communication
- No real-time updates
- Poor integration of services
- Risk of human error

#### 2.1.2 Proposed System
- Web-based platform for tourists and admins
- User registration, package browsing, online bookings, and queries
- Admin management of packages, bookings, payments, and inquiries
- Modules: registration/login, package listing, booking, payment, admin dashboard, feedback/support
- Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Apache

#### 2.1.3 Feasibility Study
Feasibility study identifies the best system to meet requirements. It includes:
- Economic Feasibility: Benefits outweigh costs (reduced paperwork, fewer errors, faster operations, better customer handling)
- Technical Feasibility: Uses widely available technologies, no high-end hardware needed, easy to train staff
- Behavioural Feasibility: Designed for end-users, easy to use, improves satisfaction, likely to be accepted

### 2.2 Requirement Specification
Requirement analysis studies the current process to find improvements. It involves preliminary and detailed analysis, leading to a requirements specification that guides software design.

#### 2.2.1 Software Requirement Specification
- Functional Requirements: View packages, register/login, manage profiles, book/cancel tours, generate invoices, admin management, reporting
