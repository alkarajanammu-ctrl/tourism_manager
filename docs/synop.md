- Admin management of packages, bookings, payments, and customer inquiries
- Modules: User registration/login, package listing, booking, payment (optional), admin dashboard, feedback/support
- Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend); PHP (Backend); MySQL (Database); Apache (Server)

#### Expected Outcome
- Automate booking and management
- User-friendly interface for customers and admins
- Real-time data access, reduced errors, improved efficiency
